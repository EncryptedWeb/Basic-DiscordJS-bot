 DiscordJS bot basics.

# Made by?
  This bot is made by Justin, A.k.a EncryptedWeb
  I've made bots for about 1 year now and i'm sharing a basic code example with you guys.

# Setup tutorial
  Go to the terminal and typ the following commands
  ```
    npm init
  ```
  and after that
  ```  
    npm install discord.js
  ```
  go to https://discordapp.com/developers
  and create a bot
  get the "token" and replace the "TOKEN_HERE" with your token.
  to start the bot go to your terminal and typ: ``node index.js``

# Free to change
  Change everything you want, just download the source, and add commands

# Example commands for support?
  I've included a "BASIC COMMAND.txt" File to help you make new commands

# Have fun with it!
